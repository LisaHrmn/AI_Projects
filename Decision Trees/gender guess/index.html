        <h3>Gender Guess Decision Tree</h3>
        <p>This decision tree predicts gender based on some interests. It takes a lot of steps to make a decision and it's still often wrong but I thought it would be fun to see what it would base the gender guess on!
            <br>For this decision tree the following data was used: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hb20007/gender-classification">https://www.kaggle.com/hb20007/gender-classification</a></p>
