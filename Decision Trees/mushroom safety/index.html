        <h3>Mushroom Safety</h3>
        <p>This decision tree predicts the safety of mushrooms, can you eat them?? It's possible! But even if you follow the decision tree and it says it's safe please don't eat random mushrooms the prediction is only about 68% accurate. 
            <br>For this decision tree the following data was used: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification">https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification</a></p>
