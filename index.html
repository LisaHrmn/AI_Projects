        <h1>Machine Learning (AI) Projects</h1>
        <p>A collection of small AI projects. They're just 'fun' small projects I made to acquaint myself with machine learning. Check them out below!</p>

            <h2>Bert Checker</h2>
            <p>For this project I trained a model to recognise my dog, Bert. Around this I build a simple UI and some interaction.
                Because the model is only trained on my dog it will only recognise my dog or dogs that look like him, or maybe a rag that's kind of the same color as him.
                This makes it a little hard to use the application if you don't have any of that. So besides a demo and the code there's also a video to see it work!

            <h2>Doodle Game</h2>
            <p>For this project I worked with ML5 Neural Networ Image Classifying. I used a pre-trained model to make a doodle game, you get a prompt to draw a certain thing, upload an image of it and get judged by the AI.
                Next to that I used BrowserSpeech so if you turn the sound on you can feel extra judged. Try the demo or check out the code!</p>

            <h2>Decision Trees</h2>
            <p>For this project I worked with datasets and the Decision Tree algorithm. This algorithm uses data to classify and predict an outcome.
                I made two Decision Trees. 
            </p>
            <h3>Mushroom Safety</h3>
            <p>This Decision Tree predicts whether a mushroom is poisonous or not based of a couple of details of the mushroom.</p>

            <h3>Gender Guess</h3>
            <p>This Decision Tree predicts gender based on someone's interests.</p>

            <h2>Mood Music</h2>
            <p>For this project I used ML5 sentiment analysis to predict the mood of a text. The mood is classified and based on the results you can get a song recomendation.
                Check out the demo or the code if you want!

            <h2>Picture Perfect</h2>
            <p>For this project I worked with the K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm. The algorithm is trained to recognise pixelated versions of a couple of van Gogh paintings.  
                The webcam takes in new data which gives an array and the algorithm finds the most similar (or the nearest neighbor) out of the trainingsdata. 
                So the app can tell what van Gogh painting the current webcam image looks most like. Try it out yourself or check out the code!
